Current problems with the sentiment analysis:
Team names being labled as negative or positive
- Quickfix, remove post match discussion post since we know these titles have no sentiment.
Doesn't filter well on gaming slang, ex. insane outplay gets a negative sentiment score when this is considered something good
- No quick fix, some mislabeling is fine can still use the scores when categorized
